# 📶 WiFi Network Analyzer

A powerful Python-based tool for scanning WiFi networks, detecting rogue access points, identifying MAC spoofing, and monitoring for deauthentication (deauth) attacks in real-time. Includes Telegram alert integration for live security notifications.

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ **WiFi Network Scanning**  
  Detects nearby wireless networks, their signal strength, security type, and BSSID.

- 🚨 **Rogue Access Point Detection**  
  Compares scanned networks against a list of known trusted BSSIDs to identify potential rogue APs.

- ⚠️ **MAC Address Spoofing Detection**  
  Monitors for devices using the same MAC address from different IPs on the same network.

- 📡 **Real-Time Deauthentication Attack Detection**  
  Listens to WiFi traffic for deauth frames and logs suspicious behavior.

- 🔔 **Telegram Alert Integration**  
  Get instant notifications for rogue APs, MAC spoofing, and deauth attacks directly on Telegram.
